This package gives you a command called 'docsh' that you can source into a script or onto the command line.  You then have a series of commands which allows you to create web directories and write into HTML boxes in certain ways.  You can create a DIV which allows freeform text, you can run PRE which captures your shell scripting, or you can run PREP which can take input from a pipe.  The logging and site creation can happen on the local server or remotely, ssh is always used, so keys will need to be set up even if it is used locally.
